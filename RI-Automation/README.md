Create an input file for the automation script based on the 'sample-format.txt' file.
Once the file has been created, pass the file as an argument to the RI-automation.sh script

NOTE: remove the '--dry-run' flag in the script file to purchase RI and make sure the IAM user has required credentials

Example: sh RI-automation.sh sample-format.txt
